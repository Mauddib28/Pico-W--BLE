# Bluetooth Audio Speaker/Headset PRD

## Project Overview
Create a Bluetooth Audio Speaker/Headset Device using BLE protocol on a Pico WH platform.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Pico WH device
- Adafruit I2S Stereo Decoder - UDA1334A Breakout board
- Integrated speaker/headset via the I2S Stereo Decoder

## Software Requirements

### Bluetooth Implementation
- Implement Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol
- Create L2CAP channel for audio data transmission
- Handle potential audio data loss and throughput limitations

### BLE GATT Server Requirements
- Implement media control functionality (play, pause, resume, stop)
- Advertise device as "BLE Audio Sink" with alias "BLE I2S"
- Provide volume control functionality
- Include status message capabilities for connected BLE central devices

### Serial Interface
- Implement command-line based user interface via serial connection
- Allow same control functions as BLE GATT server
- Provide system information checking capabilities (name, alias, status)

### Audio Processing
- Implement I2C protocol for audio data transfer to I2S Stereo Decoder
- Handle audio data processing within L2CAP channel constraints

## Documentation Requirements
- Document wiring details in "README.wiring" file and in-code comments
- Include thorough documentation for variables, functions, and code blocks
- Document inputs, outputs, and functionality of code components

## Directory Structure
- All code and documentation must be in EmbeddedSystems/AudioSink/
