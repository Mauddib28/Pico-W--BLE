"""
Bluetooth Audio Speaker/Headset - Main Script

This script implements a BLE Audio Sink device using a Pico WH and
Adafruit I2S Stereo Decoder (UDA1334A).

It enables audio data transmission over BLE protocol to the Pico WH,
which then sends the audio to speakers/headphones via the I2S Decoder.

Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi Pico WH
- Adafruit I2S Stereo Decoder - UDA1334A

Dependencies:
- MicroPython BLE libraries
- MicroPython I2S libraries

Pin Connections:
- See README.wiring for detailed wiring information
